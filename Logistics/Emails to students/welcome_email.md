Hi class,

This email contains information on required materials for this course as well as links to resources for getting ready for the course.

Required materials:

1. Textbook: OpenIntro Statistics, 3rd Edition
    - The textbook is freely available online at http://www.openintro.org/os. You're welcomed to read on screen or print it out.
    - If you prefer a paperback version you can buy it at the cost of printing on Amazon. Color hardcover and a black&white paperback versions are available. Links to where you can order them are also listed at http://www.openintro.org/os.
    - The textbook store will not carry copies of this text.

2. Clicker: i>clicker2 (ISBN: 978-1429280471):
    - If you would like to purchase a used clicker from a former student, see the list of students selling their clickers [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkY2lFgS9uiDdE1fMkZUZnp6alJDSG9tYlIwTFJWdnc#gid=0). You can contact them directly, or leave your name on the list under "Wants to buy clicker".
    - The clickers will also be available at the Duke textbook store.
    - Or you can get them for slightly cheaper [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/I-Clicker-2-I-Clicker/dp/1429280476).
    - Note that this is i>clicker2, and not i>clicker or i>clicker+.

3. Calculator: You will be allowed to use a calculator in this class. There is no restrictions on the type of calculator. A simple calculator that can take square roots should be sufficient.

If you are planning on ordering your materials online I recommend that you do so right away so that they arrive by the time classes begin. Note that Amazon offers free 2-day Prime shipping to students: http://www.amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info.

Enjoy the last few days of the winter break.

Looking forward to meeting all of you soon.

Best,
Dr. Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel

PS: A note for students on the waitlist -- lab rooms are physically limited, hence I will not be able to give permission numbers to increase enrollment in lab sections. You are absolutely welcomed to stay on the waitlist as I am sure there will be some students changing their schedules and some room will open up in the class. However, note that staying on the waitlist will not guarantee seats in the class due to this physical limitation.
